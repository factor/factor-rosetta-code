! Some languages offer direct support for algebraic data types and pattern
! matching on them. While this of course can always be simulated with
! manual tagging and conditionals, it allows for terse code which is easy
! to read, and can represent the algorithm directly.

! Task:
! 
! As an example, implement insertion in a red-black-tree.
! 
! A red-black-tree is a binary tree where each internal node has a color
! attribute red or black. Moreover, no red node can have a red child, and
! every path from the root to an empty node must contain the same number
! of black nodes. As a consequence, the tree is balanced, and must be
! re-balanced after an insertion.
