# rosetta-code

The [Rosetta Code](https://rosettacode.org) project is quite interesting:

> The idea is to present solutions to the same task in as many different
> languages as possible, to demonstrate how languages are similar and
> different, and to aid a person with a grounding in one approach to a problem
> in learning another. Rosetta Code currently has 1,298
> [tasks](*https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Solutions_by_Programming_Task),
> 383 [draft
> tasks](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Draft_Programming_Tasks), and
> is aware of 952
> [languages](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Programming_Languages),
> though we do not (and cannot) have solutions to every task in every
> language.

There is a [page for Factor](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Factor)
with some programming language history, notes, and a list of [tasks not
implemented in
Factor](https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Tasks_not_implemented_in_Factor).  If
you are new to learning Factor, this might be a fun way to learn and
contribute.

The ``rosetta-code`` vocabulary includes words for scraping solutions from
Rosetta Code, while the ``rosetta-code/solutions`` directory contains all
the currently scraped solutions.

Currently this is a fair amount of code:
