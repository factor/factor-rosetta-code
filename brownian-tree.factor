! Task:
! 
! Generate and draw a Brownian Tree.
! 
! A Brownian Tree is generated as a result of an initial seed, followed by
! the interaction of two processes.
! 
! 1.  The initial "seed" is placed somewhere within the field. Where is
!     not particularly important; it could be randomized, or it could be a
!     fixed point.
! 2.  Particles are injected into the field, and are individually given a
!     (typically random) motion pattern.
! 3.  When a particle collides with the seed or tree, its position is
!     fixed, and it's considered to be part of the tree.
! 
! Because of the lax rules governing the random nature of the particle's
! placement and motion, no two resulting trees are really expected to be
! the same, or even necessarily have the same general shape.
