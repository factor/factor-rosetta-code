! Task
! 
! Write a program to find the mode value of a collection.
! 
! The case where the collection is empty may be ignored. Care must be
! taken to handle the case where the mode is non-unique.
! 
! If it is not appropriate or possible to support a general collection,
! use a vector (array), if possible. If it is not appropriate or possible
! to support an unspecified value type, use integers.

{ 11 9 4 9 4 9 } mode ! 9
