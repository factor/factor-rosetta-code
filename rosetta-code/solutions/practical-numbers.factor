! A Practical number P has some selection of its proper divisors, (other
! than itself), that can be selected to sum to every integer less than
! itself.
! 
! Compute all the proper divisors/factors of an input number X, then,
! using all selections from the factors compute all possible sums of
! factors and see if all numbers from 1 to X-1 can be created from it.
! 
! Task:
! 
! Write a function that given X returns a boolean value of whether X is a
! Practical number, (using the above method).
! 
! -   Show how many Practical numbers there are in the range 1..333,
!     inclusive.
! -   Show that the Practical numbers in the above range start and end in:
! 
!     1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12, 16, 18, 20, 24 ... 288, 294, 300, 304, 306, 308,
!     312, 320, 324, 330
