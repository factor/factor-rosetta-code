! Some integers (greater than 1), have the property that the digital sum
! of that integer raised to some integer power greater than 1, is equal to
! the original integer.
! 
! E.G.
! 
!     {| class="wikitable"
! 
! |- | 9² == 81 || 8 + 1 == 9 |}
! 
! Some integers have this property using more than one exponent.
! 
!     {| class="wikitable"
! 
! |- | 18³ == 5832 || 5 + 8 + 3 + 2 == 18 |- | 18⁶ == 34012224 || 3 + 4 +
! 0 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 + 4 == 18 |- | 18⁷ == 612220032 || 6 + 1 + 2 + 2 + 2 +
! 0 + 0 + 3 + 2 == 18 |}
! 
! Note: every integer has an exponential digital sum equal to the original
! integer when using an exponent of 1. And, 0 and 1 raised to any power
! will have a digital sum of 0 and 1 respectively.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and show the first twenty integers (with their exponents), that
!     satisfy this condition.
! -   Find and show at least the first ten integers with their exponents,
!     that satisfy this condition in three or more ways.
