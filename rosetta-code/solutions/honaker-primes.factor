! A Honaker prime is a prime whose digital sum is equal to the digital sum
! of its position in the sequence of primes.
! 
! E.G.
! 
! If you look at the sequence of positive integer primes the first prime
! is 2 at position 1. The digital sums of 2 and 1 are not equal, so 2 is
! not a Honaker prime. The prime at position 32: 131 is a Honaker prime.
! The digital sum of 32 (5) is equal to the digital sum of 131 (5).
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Write a routine (procedure, function, filter, whatever it may be
!     called in your language) to identify Honaker primes.
! -   Use that routine to find the first fifty Honaker primes and display
!     the position and value for each.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! -   Find and display the ten thousandth Honaker prime (position and
!     value).
