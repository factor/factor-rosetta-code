! Task:
! 
! Write a function which tests if infinity is supported for floating point
! numbers (this step should be omitted for languages where the language
! specification already demands the existence of infinity, e.g. by
! demanding IEEE numbers), and if so, returns positive infinity.
! Otherwise, return the largest possible positive floating point number.
! 
! For languages with several floating point types, use the type of the
! literal constant 1.5 as floating point type.
