! Iterators are a design pattern that can be used to access elements of a
! container without depending on the implementation or type of the
! container.

! Task
! 
! -   Create an array like container to hold the days of the week and a
!     linked-list like container to hold colors.
! -   Print all of the elements of each container.
! -   Print the first, fourth, and fifth elements of each container.
! -   Print the last, fourth to last, and fifth to last of each container.
! 
! If you language supports iterators, use them. Otherwise show how access
! to elements can be separated from the containers that hold them.
