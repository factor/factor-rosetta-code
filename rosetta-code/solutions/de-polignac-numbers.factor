! Alphonse de Polignac, a French mathematician in the 1800s, conjectured
! that every positive odd integer could be formed from the sum of a power
! of 2 and a prime number.
! 
! He was subsequently proved incorrect.
! 
! The numbers that fail this condition are now known as de Polignac
! numbers.
! 
! Technically 1 is a de Polignac number, as there is no prime and power of
! 2 that sum to 1. De Polignac was aware but thought that 1 was a special
! case. However.
! 
! 127 is also fails that condition, as there is no prime and power of 2
! that sum to 127.
! 
! As it turns out, de Polignac numbers are not uncommon, in fact, there
! are an infinite number of them.
