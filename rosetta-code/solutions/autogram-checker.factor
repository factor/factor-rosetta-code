! Definition
! 
! An autogram is a sentence that describes itself in the sense of
! providing an inventory of its own characters. An essential feature is
! the use of full cardinal number names such as "one", "two", etc., in
! recording character counts.
! 
! Autograms are also called 'self-enumerating' or 'self-documenting'
! sentences. Whilst they usually just count letters of the alphabet, they
! can also count punctuation symbols as well.
! 
! Example
! 
! If punctuation is ignored, the following sentence is an autogram:
! 
!     This sentence employs two a's, two c's, two d's, twenty-eight e's, five f's, three g's, eight h's, eleven i's, three l's, two m's, thirteen n's, nine o's, two p's, five r's, twenty-five s's, twenty-three t's, six v's, ten w's, two x's, five y's, and one z.
! 
! Task
! 
! Write a routine in your language to check whether or not a given
! sentence is an autogram and use it to test the above example (Sentence
! 1.) and also the following sentences:
! 
! 2. This sentence employs two a's, two c's, two d's, twenty eight e's,
! five f's, three g's, eight h's, eleven i's, three l's, two m's, thirteen
! n's, nine o's, two p's, five r's, twenty five s's, twenty three t's, six
! v's, ten w's, two x's, five y's, and one z.
! 
! 3. Only the fool would take trouble to verify that his sentence was
! composed of ten a's, three b's, four c's, four d's, forty-six e's,
! sixteen f's, four g's, thirteen h's, fifteen i's, two k's, nine l's,
! four m's, twenty-five n's, twenty-four o's, five p's, sixteen r's,
! forty-one s's, thirty-seven t's, ten u's, eight v's, eight w's, four
! x's, eleven y's, twenty-seven commas, twenty-three apostrophes, seven
! hyphens and, last but not least, a single !
! 
! 4. This pangram contains four as, one b, two cs, one d, thirty es, six
! fs, five gs, seven hs, eleven is, one j, one k, two ls, two ms, eighteen
! ns, fifteen os, two ps, one q, five rs, twenty-seven ss, eighteen ts,
! two us, seven vs, eight ws, two xs, three ys, & one z.
! 
! 5. This sentence contains one hundred and ninety-seven letters: four
! a's, one b, three c's, five d's, thirty-four e's, seven f's, one g, six
! h's, twelve i's, three l's, twenty-six n's, ten o's, ten r's,
! twenty-nine s's, nineteen t's, six u's, seven v's, four w's, four x's,
! five y's, and one z.
! 
! 6. Thirteen e's, five f's, two g's, five h's, eight i's, two l's, three
! n's, six o's, six r's, twenty s's, twelve t's, three u's, four v's, six
! w's, four x's, two y's.
! 
! 7. Fifteen e's, seven f's, four g's, six h's, eight i's, four n's, five
! o's, six r's, eighteen s's, eight t's, four u's, three v's, two w's,
! three x's.
! 
! 8. Sixteen e's, five f's, three g's, six h's, nine i's, five n's, four
! o's, six r's, eighteen s's, eight t's, three u's, three v's, two w's,
! four z's.
! 
! Punctuation should be ignored in all cases except for sentences number
! 3. and 7. For task 3 and 7, punctuation counts must be checked, and some
! ('comma', 'apostrophe', 'hyphen') punctuation may be represented in the
! autogram using the spelled out english names for the punctuation and the
! checker must respect the inconsistent use of apostrophes in the
! spellings of the counts (while still counting apostrophes accurately)
! and must accept 'single' as a synonym for 'one'.
! 
! Note that the only difference between sentences 1. and 2. is that there
! are no hyphens in the latter.
! 
! Assumptions
! 
! -   Ignore capitalization.
! 
! -   Never count spaces or full stops.
! 
! If it helps you may also make the following simplifying assumptions:
! 
! -   No sentence will be such that there are more than 99 instances of
!     any countable character.
! 
! -   If punctuation is to be allowed for, only commas, hyphens,
!     apostrophes and exclamation marks need be counted.
