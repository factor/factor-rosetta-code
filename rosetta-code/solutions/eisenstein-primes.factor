! An Eisenstein integer is a non-unit Gaussian integer a + bω where ω(1+ω)
! = -1, and a and b are integers.
! 
! ω is generally chosen as a cube root of unity:
! ${\displaystyle \omega ={\frac {-1+i{\sqrt {3}}}{2}}=e^{i2\pi /3}}$
! 
! As with a Gaussian integer, any Eisenstein integer is either a unit (an
! integer with a multiplicative inverse [±1, ±ω, ±(ω^-1)]), a prime (a
! number p such that if p divides xy, then p necessarily divides either x
! or y), or composite (a product of primes).
! 
! An Eisenstein integer a + bω is a prime if either it is a product of a
! unit and an integer prime p such that p % 3 == 2 or norm(a + bω) is an
! integer prime.
! 
! Eisenstein numbers can be generated by choosing any a and b such that a
! and b are integers. To allow generation in a relatively fixed order,
! such numbers can be ordered by their 2-norm or norm:
! 
!     norm(eisenstein integer(a, b)) = |a + bω|² = a² − ab + b²
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find, and show here as their complex number values, the first 100
!     (by norm order) Eisenstein primes nearest 0.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! -   Plot in the complex plane at least the first 2000 such numbers
!     (again, as found with norm closest to 0).
