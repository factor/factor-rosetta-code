! Consider the list of factors (divisors) of an integer, such as 12. The
! factors of 12 are [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 12]. Consider all sorted sequences of
! the factors of n such that each succeeding number in such a sequence is
! a multiple of its predecessor. So, for 6, we have the factors (divisors)
! [1, 2, 3, 6]. The 3 unique lists of sequential multiples starting with 1
! and ending with 6 that can be derived from these factors are [1, 6], [1,
! 2, 6], and [1, 3, 6].
! 
! Another way to see these sequences is as an set of all the ordered
! factorizations of a number taken so that their product is that number
! (excluding 1 from the sequence). So, for 6, we would have [6], [2, 3],
! and [3, 2]. In this description of the sequences, we are looking at the
! numbers needed to multiply by, in order to generate the next element in
! the sequences previously listed in our first definition of the sequence
! type, as we described it in the preceding paragraph, above.
! 
! For example, for the factorization of 6, if the first type of sequence
! is [1, 6], this is generated by [6] since 1 * 6 = 6. Similarly, the
! first type of sequence [1, 2, 6] is generated by the second type of
! sequence [2, 3] because 1 * 2 = 2 and 2 * 3 = 6. Similarly, [1, 3, 6] is
! generated by [3, 2] because 1 * 3 = 3 and 3 * 2 = 6.
! 
! If we count the number of such sorted sequences of multiples, or ordered
! factorizations, and using that count find all integers `n` for which the
! count of such sequences equals `n`, we have re-created the sequence of
! the "factor-perfect" numbers (OEIS 163272).
! 
! By some convention, on its OEIS page, the factor-perfect number sequence
! starts with 0 rather than 1. As might be expected with a sequence
! involving factorization and combinations, finding factor-perfect numbers
! becomes more demanding on CPU time as the numbers become large.
! 
! ;Task:
! 
! -   Show all 48 ordered sequences for each of the two methods for n =
!     48, which is the first non-trivial factor-perfect number.
! 
! According to the paper listed below by P. Erdos, the number of these
! sequences is
! 
!     $F(n) = \sum_{k} F(\frac{n}{a_k}) + 1$
! 
! where a is a list of the factors of n, including n, but excluding 1.
! F(n) is here the same as a function for calculating the number of
! different factorizations according to the second definition above except
! that F(1)=0 (where the number of factorizations of 1 must be 1 for it to
! be included in the sequence of factor-perfect numbers).
! 
! -   Write a program to calculate and show the first 7 numbers of the
!     factor-perfect numbers.
! 
! ;Stretch task:
! 
! -   Calculate and show more of the subsequent numbers in the sequence.
