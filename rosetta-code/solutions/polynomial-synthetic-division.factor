!     In algebra, polynomial synthetic division is an algorithm for
!     dividing a polynomial by another polynomial of the same or lower
!     degree in an efficient way using a trick involving clever
!     manipulations of coefficients, which results in a lower time
!     complexity than polynomial long division.
