! Task:
! 
! Given a set of data vectors in the following format:
! 
!    y = {y₁, y₂, ..., y_(n)} 
! 
!    X_(i) = {x_(i1), x_(i2), ..., x_(in)}, i ∈ 1..k 
! 
! Compute the vector β = {β₁, β₂, ..., β_(k)} using ordinary least squares
! regression using the following equation:
! 
!    y_(j) = Σ_(i)β_(i) ⋅ x_(ij), j ∈ 1..n
! 
! You can assume y is given to you as a vector (a one-dimensional array),
! and X is given to you as a two-dimensional array (i.e. matrix).
