! Task:
! 
! Find a graph with 17 Nodes such that any 4 Nodes are neither totally
! connected nor totally unconnected, so demonstrating Ramsey's theorem.
! 
! A specially-nominated solution may be used, but if so it must be checked
! to see if if there are any sub-graphs that are totally connected or
