! The aim of the game is to be the first player to score 500 points,
! achieved (usually over several rounds of play) by being the first to
! play all of one's own cards and scoring points for the cards still held
! by the other players.
! 
! The deck consists of 108 cards: four each of "Wild" and "Wild Draw
! Four", and 25 each of four colors (red, yellow, green, blue). Each color
! consists of one zero, two each of 1 through 9, and two each of "Skip",
! "Draw Two", and "Reverse". These last three types are known as "action
! cards".
! 
! To start a hand, seven cards are dealt to each player, and the top card
! of the remaining deck is flipped over and set aside to begin the discard
! pile. The player to the dealer's left plays first unless the first card
! on the discard pile is an action or Wild card (see below). On a player's
! turn, they must do one of the following:
! 
! play one card matching the discard in color, number, or symbol play a
! Wild card, or a playable Wild Draw Four card (see restriction below)
! draw the top card from the deck, then play it if possible Cards are
! played by laying them face-up on top of the discard pile. Play proceeds
! clockwise around the table.
! 
! Action or Wild cards have the following effects:
! 
! Card
! 
! Effect when played from hand
! 
! Effect as first discard
! 
! Skip
! 
! Next player in sequence misses a turn
! 
! Player to dealer's left misses a turn
! 
! Reverse
! 
! Order of play switches directions (clockwise to counterclockwise, or
! vice versa)
! 
! Dealer plays first; play proceeds counterclockwise
! 
! Draw Two (+2)
! 
! Next player in sequence draws two cards and misses a turn
! 
! Player to dealer's left draws two cards and misses a turn
! 
! Wild
! 
! Player declares the next color to be matched (may be used on any turn
! even if the player has matching color; current color may be chosen as
! the next to be matched)
! 
! Player to dealer's left declares the first color to be matched and plays
! a card in it
! 
! Wild Draw Four/Draw Four Wild (+4 and wild)
! 
! Player declares the next color to be matched; next player in sequence
! draws four cards and misses a turn. May be legally played only if the
! player has no cards of the current color (see Penalties).
! 
! Return card to the deck, shuffle, flip top card to start discard pile
! 
! A player who draws from the deck must either play or keep that card and
! may play no other card from their hand on that turn.
! 
! A player may play a Wild card at any time, even if that player has other
! playable cards.
! 
! A player may play a Wild Draw Four card only if that player has no cards
! matching the current color. The player may have cards of a different
! color matching the current number or symbol or a Wild card and still
! play the Wild Draw Four card. A player who plays a Wild Draw Four may be
! challenged by the next player in sequence (see Penalties) to prove that
! their hand meets this condition.
! 
! If the entire deck is used during play, the top discard is set aside and
! the rest of the pile is shuffled to create a new deck. Play then
! proceeds normally.
! 
! It is illegal to trade cards of any sort with another player.
! 
! A player who plays their next-to-last-card must call "uno" as a warning
! to the other players.
! 
! The first player to get rid of their last card ("going out") wins the
! hand and scores points for the cards held by the other players. Number
! cards count their face value, all action cards count 20, and Wild and
! Wild Draw Four cards count 50. If a Draw Two or Wild Draw Four card is
! played to go out, the next player in the sequence must draw the
! appropriate number of cards before the score is tallied.
! 
! The first player to score 500 points wins the game.
! 
! Penalties
! 
! If a player does not call "uno" after laying down their next-to-last
! card and is caught before the next player in sequence takes a turn
! (i.e., plays a card from their hand, draws from the deck, or touches the
! discard pile), they must draw two cards as a penalty. If the player is
! not caught in time (subject to interpretation) or remembers to call
! "uno" before being caught, they suffer no penalty.
! 
! If a player plays a Wild Draw Four card, the following player can
! challenge its use. The player who used the Wild Draw Four must privately
! show their hand to the challenging player, in order to demonstrate that
! they had no matching colored cards. If the challenge is correct, then
! the challenged player draws four cards instead. If the challenge is
! wrong, then the challenger must draw six cards; the four cards they were
! already required to draw plus two more cards,
! 
! It is optional to include the House Rules
