! If the product of the divisors of an integer n (including n itself) is
! equal to n^2, then n is a multiplicatively perfect number.
! Alternatively: the product of the proper divisors of n (i.e. excluding
! n) is equal to n.
! 
! Note that the integer '1' qualifies under the first definition (1 = 1 x
! 1), but not under the second since '1' has no proper divisors. Given
! this ambiguity, it is optional whether '1' is included or not in
! solutions to this task.
