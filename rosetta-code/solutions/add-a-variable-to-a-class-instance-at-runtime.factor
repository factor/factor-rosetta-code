! Demonstrate how to dynamically add variables to an object (a class
! instance) at runtime.
! 
! This is useful when the methods/variables of an instance are based on a
! data file that isn't available until runtime. Hal Fulton gives an
! example of creating an OO CSV parser at An Exercise in Metaprogramming
! with Ruby. This is referred to as "monkeypatching" by Pythonistas and
! some others.
