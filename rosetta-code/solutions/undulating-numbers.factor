! An Undulating number in some base is a number which has the digit form
! ABABAB... where A and B are digits in that base.
! 
! For the purposes of this task, we shall only consider a number to be
! undulating if it has at least 3 digits in a given base and A != B.
! 
! Examples
! 
! The numbers: 101 and 9898 are undulating numbers in base 10.
! 
! The numbers: 50 and 2350 are undulating numbers in base 7 because their
! base 7 representations are: 101 and 6565 respectively.
! 
! Task
! 
! For base 10, find and show on this page:
! 
! 1. All three digit undulating numbers.
! 
! 2. All four digit undulating numbers.
! 
! 3. All three digit undulating numbers which are primes.
! 
! 4. The 600th undulating number.
! 
! 5. How many undulating numbers are less than 2^53 and the largest such
! number.
! 
! Bonus
! 
! Do the same for base 7 expressing the results in base 10 apart from 4.
! and 5. which should be expressed in base 7 also.
! 
! Note that undulating numbers with a given number of digits in base 7
! may, of course, have less digits when expressed in base 10 and are
! unlikely to be still undulating. However, 121 (or 232 in base 7) is an
! exception to this.
