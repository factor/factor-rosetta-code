! Definition
! 
! For the purposes of this task, a qualifying number is a non-negative
! integer, k, whose last letter is the same as the first letter of k+1
! when written in English.
! 
! For example, 18 (i.e 'eighteen' in English) is a qualifying number
! because its last letter 'n' is the same as the first letter of
! 'nineteen'.
! 
! Take the English equivalent of 0 to be 'zero' and not 'nought' or
! similar words.
! 
! For numbers such as 100 or 1000, the equivalent English should be taken
! as 'one hundred' or 'one thousand' and not 'a hundred' or 'a thousand'.
! 
! Task
! 
! 1. Find and show here the first 50 qualifying numbers.
