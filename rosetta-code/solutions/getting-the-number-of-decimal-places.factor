! Task:
! 
! Write a program (function) to get the number of decimal places in a
! given number.
! 
! Examples:
! 
! -   -   for num = 12.345 decimals = 3, and
!     -   for num = 12.3450 decimals = 4
! 
! (Note that the reference implementation – in the Ring language – shows a
! function over a given number rather than a given numeric string, and
! that the sample values shown above are not enclosed in quotes).
