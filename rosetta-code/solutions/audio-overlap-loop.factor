! Audio Overlap Loop is a program that produces an "echo chamber" effect
! by playing an audio file several times in an overlapping loop. A
! repetition level determines the number of times that the file is looped.
! For the purpose of this task, write a program that takes a parameter for
! the number of repetitions and plays the file loop.wav in an overlapping
! loop according to the number of repetitions.
! 
! Optionally take parameters for delay between repetitions, and decay
! (fractional volume reduction between consecutive repetitions).
