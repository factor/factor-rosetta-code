! The smallest enclosing circle problem (aka minimum covering circle
! problem, bounding circle problem) is a mathematical problem of computing
! the smallest circle that contains all of a given set of points in the
! Euclidean plane.
! 
! Initially it was proposed by the English mathematician James Joseph
! Sylvester in 1857.
! 
! Task:
! 
! Find circle of smallest radius containing all of given points.
! 
! -   Circle is defined by it's center and radius;
! -   Points are defined by their coordinates in n-dimensional space;
! -   Circle (sphere) contains point when distance between point and
!     circle center <= circle radius.
