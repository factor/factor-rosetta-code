! Definition
! 
! In object-oriented programming, an inner or nested class is a class
! declared entirely within the body of another class or interface.
! 
! It is not the same as a subclass which is a class which inherits members
! from another class or classes and can be declared anywhere the parent
! class(es) are within scope. However, inner classes may nevertheless be
! subclasses of other classes as well.
! 
! Task
! 
! If your language supports the object oriented paradigm, explain what
! support it has for inner classes and, if there is no support, what if
! anything can be done to simulate them.
! 
! Illustrate your answer by creating an inner class with a constructor, an
! instance method and field and show how to instantiate it.
! 
! If your language does not support the object oriented paradigm, you may
! either omit this task or describe (and substitute in your example) any
! equivalent structure(s) which the language does have.
