! In plane geometry, a line (or segment) may intersect a circle at 0, 1 or
! 2 points.
! 
! Task
! 
! Implement a method (function, procedure etc.) in your language which
! takes as parameters:
! 
! -   the starting point of a line;
! -   the point where the line ends;
! -   the center point of a circle;
! -   the circle's radius; and
! -   whether the line is a segment or extends to infinity beyond the
!     above points.
! 
! The method should return the intersection points (if any) of the circle
! and the line.
! 
! Illustrate your method with some examples (or use the Go examples
! below).
! 
! Stretch Task
! 
! Include results for a circle with center at (10, 10) and radius 5
! combined with a line through points (5, 0) and (5, 20) and that same
! circle combined with a line segment from (-5, 10) to (5, 10).
