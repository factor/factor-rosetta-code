! ASCII is the American Standard Code for Information Interchange. There
! are 128 ASCII characters of which the first 32 and the last are 'control
! characters'.
! 
! Task
! 
! Show how your language might treat control characters en bloc by using
! an enum, an enum like structure or other approach to associate their
! names with their ASCII values thereby enabling them to be retrieved or
! listed by name.
! 
! Technically, the 33rd character 'space' is a printable character, not a
! control character, though you may treat it as the latter for the
! purposes of this task.
