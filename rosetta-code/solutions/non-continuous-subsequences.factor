! Consider some sequence of elements. (It differs from a mere set of
! elements by having an ordering among members.)
! 
! A subsequence contains some subset of the elements of this sequence, in
! the same order.
! 
! A continuous subsequence is one in which no elements are missing between
! the first and last elements of the subsequence.
! 
! Note: Subsequences are defined structurally, not by their contents. So a
! sequence a,b,c,d will always have the same subsequences and continuous
! subsequences, no matter which values are substituted; it may even be the
! same value.
! 
! Task: Find all non-continuous subsequences for a given sequence.
! 
! Example:
! 
! For the sequence 1,2,3,4, there are five non-continuous subsequences,
! namely:
! 
! -   -   1,3
!     -   1,4
!     -   2,4
!     -   1,3,4
!     -   1,2,4
! 
! Goal:
! 
! There are different ways to calculate those subsequences.
! 
! Demonstrate algorithm(s) that are natural for the language.
