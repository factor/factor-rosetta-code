! Definitions
! 
! A cubefree number is a positive integer whose prime factorization does
! not contain any third (or higher) power factors. If follows that all
! primes are trivially cubefree and the first cubefree number is 1 because
! it has no prime factors.
! 
! Let a[n] be the greatest prime dividing the n-th cubefree number for
! n >= 2. By convention, let a[1] = 1 even though the first cubefree
! number, 1, has no prime factors.
! 
! Examples
! 
! a[2] is clearly 2 because it is the second cubefree number and also
! prime. The fourth cubefree number is 4 and it's highest prime factor is
! 2, hence a[4] = 2.
! 
! Task
! 
! Compute and show on this page the first 100 terms of a[n]. Also compute
! and show the 1,000th, 10,000th and 100,000th members of the sequence.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! Compute and show the 1 millionth and 10 millionth terms of the sequence.
! 
! This may take a while for interpreted languages.
