! Generalised 2-designs with Block Size 3(Andy L. Drizen) describes a
! method of generating Latin Squares of order n attributed to Jacobson and
! Matthews. The purpose of this task is to produce a function which given
! a valid Latin Square transforms it to another using this method.
! 
! part 1
! 
! Use one of the 4 Latin Squares in reduced form of order 4 as X0 to
! generate 10000 Latin Squares using X(n-1) to generate X(n). Convert the
! resulting Latin Squares to their reduced form, display them and the
! number of times each is produced.
! 
! part 2
! 
! As above for order 5, but do not display the squares. Generate the 56
! Latin Squares in reduced form of order 5, confirm that all 56 are
! produced by the Jacobson and Matthews technique and display the number
! of each produced.
! 
! part 3
! 
! Generate 750 Latin Squares of order 42 and display the 750th.
! 
! part 4
! 
! Generate 1000 Latin Squares of order 256. Don't display anything but
! confirm the approximate time taken and anything else you may find
! interesting
