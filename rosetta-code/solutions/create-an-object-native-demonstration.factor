! Create a Hash/Associative Array/Dictionary-like object that can be
! initialized with key/value pairs. The object should behave like a native
! Hash/Associative Array/Dictionary of the language, but with the
! following differences:
! 
! -   No new keys can be added;
! -   Keys cannot be removed;
! -   Attempting to delete a key should set that keys value back to that
!     used during initialisation.
! 
! (The value assigned to keys may be changed by normal assignment
! however).
! 
! If the language supports Magic Methods, then show how these work.
