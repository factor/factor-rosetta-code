! For this task, for our purposes, a cuboid is a 3 dimensional object,
! with six rectangular faces, where all angles are right angles, opposite
! faces of the cuboid are equal, and where each dimension is a positive
! integer unit length. It will subsequently be referred to simply as a
! cuboid; but be aware that it references the above definition.
! 
! The surface area of a cuboid is two times the length times the width,
! plus two times the length times the height, plus two times the width
! times the height. A cuboid will always have an even integer surface
! area. The minimum surface area a cuboid may have is 6; one where the l,
! w, and h measurements are all 1.
! 
!   2 × ( l × w + w × h + h × l )
!   2 × ( 1 × 1 + 1 × 1 + 1 × 1 ) = 6
! 
! Different cuboid configurations (may) yield different surface areas, but
! the surface area is always an integer and is always even.
! 
! A cuboid with l = 2, w = 1 h = 1 has a surface area of 10
! 
!   2 × ( 2 × 1 + 1 × 1 + 1 × 2 ) = 10
! 
! There is no configuration which will yield a surface area of 8.
! 
! There are 16 known even integer values below 1000 which can not be a
! surface area for any integer cuboid. It is conjectured, though not
! rigorously proved, that no others exist.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and display the sixteen even integer values larger than 6 (the
!     minimum cuboid area) and less than 1000
! 
! that can not be the surface area of a cuboid.
