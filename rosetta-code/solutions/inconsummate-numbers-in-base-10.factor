! A consummate number is a non-negative integer that can be formed by some
! integer N divided by the the digital sum of N.
! 
! For instance
! 
! 47 is a consummate number.
! 
!    846 / (8 + 4 + 6) = 47
! 
! On the other hand, there are integers that can not be formed by a ratio
! of any integer over its digital sum. These numbers are known as
! inconsummate numbers.
! 
! 62 is an inconsummate number. There is no integer ratio of an integer to
! its digital sum that will result in 62.
! 
! The base that a number is expressed in will affect whether it is
! inconsummate or not. This task will be restricted to base 10.
! 
! Task

!     numbers.
