! AudioAlarm is a program that asks the user to enter a certain number,
! representing a number of seconds. After the user enters the number, the
! program will ask the user to enter the name of an MP3 audio file
! (without the .mp3 file extension). The program will then display a
! (usually blank) page. After the time (indicated by the number) is up, a
! sound (indicated by the MP3 file) will go off. Useful for timers and
! alarm clocks. The app must be installed in its own folder, preferrably
! with a name like AudioAlarm. To install a sound on the app, just copy
! the MP3 to the app folder you set up. Then, when the app asks you for
! the filename, you just type in the name without an extension.
