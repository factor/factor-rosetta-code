! A sub-unit square is a square number (product of two identical
! non-negative integers) that remains a square after having a 1 subtracted
! from each digit in the square.
! 
! E.G.
! 
! The number 1 is a sub-unit square. 1 - 1 is 0, which is also a square,
! though it's kind-of a degenerate case.
! 
! The number 3136 is a sub-unit square. 3136 (56²) with unit 1 subtracted
! from each digit is 2025 (45²).
! 
! A sub-unit square cannot contain a digit zero (0) since zero minus one
! is negative one. Every known sub-unit square, with the exception of 1,
! ends with the digits 36.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and display at least the first five sub-unit squares.
