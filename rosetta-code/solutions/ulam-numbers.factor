! With the following initial conditions:
! 
!       u¹ = 1 
!       u² = 2 
! 
! We define the n^(th) Ulam number u_(n) as the smallest number that is
! greater than u_(n-1) and
! 
! is the unique sum of two different Ulam numbers u_(i(<n)) and u_(j(<n)).
! 
! Task:
! 
! Write a function to generate the n^(th) Ulam number.
