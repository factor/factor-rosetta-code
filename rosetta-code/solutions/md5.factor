! Task:
! 
! Encode a string using an MD5 algorithm. The algorithm can be found on
! Wikipedia.
! 
! Optionally, validate your implementation by running all of the test
! values in IETF RFC (1321) for MD5.
! 
! Additionally, RFC 1321 provides more precise information on the
! algorithm than the Wikipedia article.
! 
! If the solution on this page is a library solution, see
! MD5/Implementation for an implementation from scratch.
