! First, show the shortest possible program that will emit the
! nine-character string “Code Golf”, without the quotation marks and
! without anything after the final “f”. Then show the shortest possible
! program that does the same thing but without itself containing any
! string or character literals, and without requiring any input or any
! environment variables or command-line arguments, though the name of the
! running program can be used.
! 
! Extra credit: how big is the executable required to perform the first
! task? Skip details about any prior compilation steps that might be
