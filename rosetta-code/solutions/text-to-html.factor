! When developing a Website it is occasionally necessary to handle text
! that is received without formatting, and present it in a pleasing
! manner. to achieve this the text needs to be converted to HTML.
! 
! Write a converter from plain text to HTML.
! 
! The plain text has no formatting information.
! 
! It may have centered headlines, numbered sections, paragraphs, lists,
! and URIs. It could even have tables.
! 
! Simple converters restrict themselves at identifying paragraphs, but i
! believe more can be done if the text is analyzed.
! 
! You are not requested to copy the algorithm from the existing solutions
! but use whatever faculties available in your language to best solve the
! problem.
! 
! The only requirement is to ensure that the result is valid xhtml.
