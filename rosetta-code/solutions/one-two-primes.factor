! Generate the sequence a_(n) where each term in a is the smallest n digit
! prime number (in base 10) composed entirely of the digits 1 and 2.
! 
! It is conjectured, though not proven, that a conforming prime exists for
! all n. No counter examples have been found up to several thousand
! digits.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and show here, the first 20 elements in the sequence (from 1
!     digit through 20 digits), or as many as reasonably supported by your
!     language if it is fewer.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! -   Find and and show the abbreviated values for the elements with n
!     equal to 100 through 2000 in increments of 100.
! 
!     Shorten the displayed number by replacing any leading 1s in the
!     number with the count of 1s, and show the remainder of the number.
