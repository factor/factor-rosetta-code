! Does the language implementation allow for a "safer mode" of execution?
! Usually termed Safe mode, a more realistic view is probably Safer mode
! or restricted mode. It is one thing to place restrictions on execution,
! and another thing entirely to allow execution of scripts from untrusted
! sources and assume nothing untoward will happen.
! 
! Along with a simple yes/no answer, describe what features are restricted
! when running in safe mode.
