! Background
! 
! In three recent races at Rosetta Park, the results have been:
! 
! Race 1
! 
!   Pos   Horse   Weight   Dist   Sex
!   ----- ------- -------- ------ -------
!   1     A       9.00     0.0    Colt
!   2     B       8.06     2.0    Filly
!   3     C       9.04     1.5    Colt
! 
! Time 1 minute 36.0 seconds
! 
! Race 2
! 
!   Pos   Horse   Weight   Dist   Sex
!   ----- ------- -------- ------ -------
!   1     D       8.10     0.0    Filly
!   2     E       9.03     1.0    Colt
!   3     F       9.07     3.0    Colt
! 
! (F was slowly away and lost 2 lengths at the finish as a result)
! 
! Time 1 minute 36.4 seconds
! 
! Race 3
! 
!   Pos   Horse   Weight   Dist   Sex
!   ----- ------- -------- ------ -------
!   1     G       8.04     0.0    Colt
!   2     H       8.10     1.5    Colt
!   3     I       9.05     0.5    Filly
! 
! Time 1 minute 35.8 seconds
! 
! It is assumed that:
! 
! 1. Weights carried are expressed in stones and pounds (traditional in US
! and UK racing) where 1 stone equals 14 pounds.
! 
! 2. The distances are the actual distances between horses at the finish
! of the race.
! 
! 3. All races are run at 1 mile in similar going and weather conditions
! and the time shown is the time taken by the winner to run the race.
! 
! 4. 2 pounds slows a horse down by 1 length at the finish.
! 
! 5. 1 second is equivalent to 5 lengths at the finish.
! 
! Task
! 
! All 9 of these horses, plus a further horse J, are due to compete
! against each other in Race 4 at Rosetta Park again over 1 mile and in
! similar conditions to the earlier races. Colts will carry 9.00 and
! fillies 8.11.
! 
! Suppose that:
! 
! 1. Horse B has been moving well on the galops and her trainer thinks she
! has improved 4 pounds since her last outing.
! 
! 2. Horse C has had a setback in training and his trainer expects him to
! perform 4 pounds below his best.
! 
! 3. Horse H is being ridden by the champion jockey which is expected to
! improve his performance by 3 pounds compared to what it would otherwise
! have been.
! 
! 4. Horse J, a filly, has never run before but her performance on the
! galops suggests she can run 1 mile in 1 minute 35.8 seconds when
! carrying 8.11.
! 
! Other things being equal (which they seldom are in actual horse racing!)
! what would you expect the full result of Race 4 to be including the time
! of the winner?
