! Idoneal numbers (also called suitable numbers or convenient numbers) are
! the positive integers D such that any integer expressible in only one
! way as x² ± Dy² (where x² is relatively prime to Dy²) is a prime power
! or twice a prime power.
! 
! A positive integer n is idoneal if and only if it cannot be written as
! ab + bc + ac for distinct positive integers a, b, and c with 0 < a < b <
! c.
! 
! There are only 65 known iodoneal numbers and is likely that no others
! exist. If there are others, it has been proven that there are at most,
! two more, and that no others exist below 1,000,000.
