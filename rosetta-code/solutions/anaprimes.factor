! Anaprimes are prime numbers that are anagrams of each other, i.e. they
! use exactly the same digits with the same frequency but in a different
! order.
! 
! Anaprimes are very common. To illustrate this, we will investigate the
! sizes of the equivalence classes defined by the "is an anagram of"
! relation.
! 
! For example, the equivalence class of 149 has four anaprimes: {149, 419,
! 491, 941}. It turns out that there is no larger equivalence class of
! 3-digit anaprimes.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find prime numbers that are anagrams of each other.
! -   Find the largest anagram group of prime numbers and display the
!     count, and minimum and maximum members for prime numbers:
!     -   up to three digits long (before 1,000)
!     -   up to four digits long (before 10,000)
!     -   up to five digits long (before 100,000)
!     -   up to six digits long (before 1,000,000)
!

! -   Find the largest anagram group and display the count, and smallest
!     and largest members for prime numbers:
!     -   up to seven digits long (before 10,000,000)
!     -   up to eight digits long (before 100,000,000)
!     -   up to nine digits long (before 1,000,000,000)
!     -   ???!
