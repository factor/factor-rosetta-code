! In 1742, Goldbach and Euler corresponded about what is now known as the
! Goldbach Conjecture: that all even integers greater than 2 can be
! written as the sum of two primes.
! 
! In 2000, Henry Dubner proposed a stronger conjecture: that every even
! integer greater than 4208 can be written as the sum of two twin primes.
! 
! At the time the Goldbach conjecture was made, 1 was considered a prime
! number - this is not so now. So, the Goldbach conjecture was originally
! that all even natural numbers could be written as the sum of two primes.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and display the positive even integers that cannot be expressed
!     as the sum of two twin primes, up to a limit of 5,000.
! 
!     
! 
!         E.g.: The first 3 twin primes are 3, 5 and 7, so 6 (3+3), 8
!         (5+3) and 10 (5+5 or 7+3) can be formed but 2 and 4 cannot.
! 
! -   Show the numbers that cannot be formed by summing two twin primes
!     when 1 is treated as a prime (and so a twin prime).
! 
! Note
! 
! -   For the purposes of this task, twin prime refers to a prime that is
!     2 more or less than another prime, not the pair of primes.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! -   Verify that there no more such numbers up to 10,000 or more, as you
!     like (note it has been verified up to at least 10^9).
