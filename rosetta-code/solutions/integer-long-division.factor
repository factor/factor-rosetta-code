! Write a function that prints the result of the division of two positive
! integers with infinite precision (only limited by the available memory),
! stopping before the period starts repeating itself. Return also the
! length of this period (0 if there is no period).
! 
! Demonstrate it with the division 1/149, whose result is
! 0.0067114093959731543624161073825503355704697986577181208053691275167785234899328859060402684563758389261744966442953020134228187919463087248322147651,
! where the last 148 digits repeat endlessly.
! 
! The result could be stored as a string or simply output to the screen.
! 
! Note that the division of any two integers will always produce a period,
! but if the numerator is an exact multiple of the denominator, or if the
! denominator contains only the factors 2 and 5, the period will be 0. In
! the remaining cases, these possible 2's and 5's of the denominator
! produce a leading number of digits in the quotient, but have no effect
! on the period.
