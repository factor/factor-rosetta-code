! Determine if a character string is collapsible.
! 
! And if so, collapse the string (by removing immediately repeated
! characters).
! 
! If a character string has immediately repeated character(s), the
! repeated characters are to be deleted (removed), but not the primary
! (1^(st)) character(s).
! 
! An immediately repeated character is any character that is immediately
! followed by an identical character (or characters). Another word choice
! could've been duplicated character, but that might have ruled out (to
! some readers) triplicated characters ··· or more.
! 
! {This Rosetta Code task was inspired by a newly introduced (as of around
! November 2019) PL/I BIF: collapse.}
! 
! Examples
! 
!     
! 
! In the following character string:
! 
!  The better the 4-wheel drive, the further you'll be from help when ya get stuck! 
! 
! Only the 2^(nd) t, e, and l are repeated characters, indicated by
! underscores (above), even though they (those characters) appear
! elsewhere in the character string.
! 
! So, after collapsing the string, the result would be:
! 
!  The beter the 4-whel drive, the further you'l be from help when ya get stuck! 
! 
! Another example: In the following character string:
! 
!  headmistressship 
! 
! The "collapsed" string would be:
! 
!  headmistreship 
! 
! Task
! 
!     
! 
! Write a subroutine/function/procedure/routine··· to locate repeated
! characters and collapse (delete) them from the character string. The
! character string can be processed from either direction.
! 
! Show all output here, on this page:
! 
! - - the original string and its length
!   - the resultant string and its length
!   - the above strings should be "bracketed" with <<< and >>> (to
!     delineate blanks)
! 
! * «««Guillemets may be used instead for "bracketing" for the more artistic programmers, shown used here»»»
! 
! Use (at least) the following five strings, all strings are length
! seventy-two (characters, including blanks), except the 1^(st) string:
! 
!  string
!  number
