! Task:
! 
! Generate a sequence of permutations of n elements drawn from choice of k
! values.
! 
! This sequence will have n^(k) elements, unless the program decides to
! terminate early.
! 
! Do not store all the intermediate values of the sequence, rather
! generate them as required, and pass the intermediate result to a
! deciding routine for combinations selection and/or early generator
! termination.
! 
! For example: When "cracking" a "combination" lock a sequence is
! required, but the sequence is terminated once a successful "combination"
! is found. This case is a good example of where it is not required to
! store all the intermediate permutations.
