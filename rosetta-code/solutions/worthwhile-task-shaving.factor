! Recreate https://xkcd.com/1205/ which shows a (humorous) table of how
! long you can work on making a routine task more efficient before
! spending more time than saved, for various s(h)avings against how often
! the task is run (over the course of five years).
! 
! There are of course several possible interpretations of "day" and "week"
! in this context. The Phix implementation assumes 8 hour days and 5 day
! weeks might be more realistic, whereas it seems the original author
! worked with 24 hour days and 7 day weeks, and, tbh, my interest is
! piqued to see what built-in facilities other languages might have for
! handling such non-standard terms, if any. Extra kudos awarded for
! getting into the mind of the original author and reproducing their
! results exactly (see talk page), or drumming up non-trivial (but still
! elegant) and potentially actually useful routines. This task can be made
! as trivial or as convoluted as you please, and should aim more for a
! little playfulness than rigid scientific accuracy.
