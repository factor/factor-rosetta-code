! As the integers get larger, the spacing between prime numbers slowly
! lengthens, but the spacing between primes increases at a slower rate
! than the numbers themselves increase. A consequence of this difference
! in rates of increase is the existence of special primes, called
! Ramanujan primes.
! 
! The `n`th Ramanujan prime is defined to be the least integer for which
! there are at least n primes between x and x/2 for all x greater or equal
! to n.
