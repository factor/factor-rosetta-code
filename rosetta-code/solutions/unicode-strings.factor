! As the world gets smaller each day, internationalization becomes more
! and more important. For handling multiple languages, Unicode is your
! best friend.
! 
! It is a very capable and remarquable tool, but also quite complex
! compared to older single- and double-byte character encodings.
! 
! How well prepared is your programming language for Unicode?
! 
! Task:
! 
! Discuss and demonstrate its unicode awareness and capabilities.
! 
! Some suggested topics:
! 
! -   -   How easy is it to present Unicode strings in source code?
!     -   Can Unicode literals be written directly, or be part of
!         identifiers/keywords/etc?
!     -   How well can the language communicate with the rest of the
!         world?
!     -   Is it good at input/output with Unicode?
!     -   Is it convenient to manipulate Unicode strings in the language?
!     -   How broad/deep does the language support Unicode?
!     -   What encodings (e.g. UTF-8, UTF-16, etc) can be used?
!     -   Does it support normalization?
! 
! Note:
! 
! This task is a bit unusual in that it encourages general discussion
! rather than clever coding.
