! Task:
! 
! Create a program that will calculate n decimal digits of the square root
! of a nonâ”€negative number.
! 
! The program should continue forever (or until the number of digits is
! specified) calculating and outputting each decimal digit in succession.
! 
! The program should be a "spigot algorithm" generating the digits of the
! number sequentially from left to right providing increasing precision as
! the algorithm proceeds.
