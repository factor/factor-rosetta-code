! Copy part of input records to an output file.
! 
! Show how file processing as known from PL/I or COBOL can be implemented
! in the language of your choice.
! 
! Here, a file is not 'just' a sequence of bytes or lines but a sequence
! of records (structured data).
! 
! The structure is usually described by declarations contained in an
! INCLUDE file (PL/I) or COPY BOOK (COBOL).
! 
! The by name assignment is a little extra available in PL/I.
! 
! Data conversions may be necessary (as shown here for data element c in
! the Go listing).
