! Given the coordinates of a rectangle and a number, cut the rectangle
! into that number of random, non-similar triangles that exactly cover the
! rectangle without gaps or overlaps.
! 
! The number of triangles may have reasonable limits such as being above a
! small limit, and/or odd or even, and/or prime for example.
! 
! The number should not have an upper bound however, so that many
! triangles can be generated.
! 
! -   Explain, or refer to the algorithm employed.
! -   Give a sample of sets of triangles produced from running the
!     algorithm, on this page.
