! Generate the sequence of primes where each term is the smallest prime
! whose reciprocal can be added to the cumulative sum and remain smaller
! than 1.
! 
! E.G.
!     The cumulative reciprocal sum with zero terms is 0. The smallest
!     prime whose reciprocal can be added to the sum without reaching or
!     exceeding 1 is 2, so the first term is 2 and the new cumulative
!     reciprocal sum is 1/2.
! 
!     The smallest prime whose reciprocal can be added to the sum without
!     reaching or exceeding 1 is 3. (2 would cause the cumulative
!     reciprocal sum to reach 1.) So the next term is 3, and the new
!     cumulative sum is 5/6.
! 
!     and so on...
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and display the first 10 terms of the sequence. (Or as many as
!     reasonably supported by your language if it is less.) For any values
!     with more than 40 digits, show the first and last 20 digits and the
!     overall digit count.
! 
! If any of the tests for primality used in your program are probabilistic
! please so indicate.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! -   Find and display the next 5 terms of the sequence. (Or as many as
!     you have the patience for.) Show only the first and last 20 digits
!     and the overall digit count.
