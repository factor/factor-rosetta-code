! Klarner-Rado sequences are a class of similar sequences that were
! studied by the mathematicians David Klarner and Richard Rado.
! 
! The most well known is defined as the thinnest strictly ascending
! sequence K which starts 1, then, for each element n, it will also
! contain somewhere in the sequence, 2 × n + 1'' and3 × n + 1''.
! 
! So, the sequence K starts with 1.
! 
! Set n equal to the first element 1; the sequence will also contain 2 ×
! n + 1 and 3 × n + 1, or 3 and 4.
! 
! Set n equal to the next element: 3, somewhere in the sequence it will
! contain 2 × n + 1 and 3 × n + 1, or 7 and 10.
! 
! Continue setting n equal to each element in turn to add to the sequence.
! 
! Task
! 
! -   Find and display the first one hundred elements of the sequence.
! -   Find and display the one thousandth and ten thousandth elements of
!     the sequence.
! 
! Preferably without needing to find an over abundance and sorting.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! -   Find and display the one hundred thousandth and one millionth
!     elements of the sequence.
