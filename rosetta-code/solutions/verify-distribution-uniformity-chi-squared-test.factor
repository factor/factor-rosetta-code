! Task:
! 
! Write a function to determine whether a given set of frequency counts
! could plausibly have come from a uniform distribution by using the χ²
! test with a significance level of 5%.
! 
! The function should return a boolean that is true if and only if the
! distribution is one that a uniform distribution (with appropriate number
! of degrees of freedom) may be expected to produce.
! 
! Note: normally a two-tailed test would be used for this kind of problem.
! 
! Reference:
! 
! -   -   an entry at the MathWorld website: chi-squared distribution.
