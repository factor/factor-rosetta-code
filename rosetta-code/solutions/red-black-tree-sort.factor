! Implement red-black tree sorting of fixed width integers. Here, the left
! branch will only contain nodes with a smaller key and the right branch
! will only contain nodes with a larger key.
! 
! Start with an empty tree, add 30 nodes each with arbitrary (aka
! "random") keys, then traverse the tree, printing the values from the
! left node, the key value, then the values from the right node,
! displaying their value and their color (red or black). Since we are
! using a red-black tree here, this would eliminate any duplicate values.
! 
! Then delete an arbitrary 15 nodes and display the resulting tree.
! 
! You may use an implementation at Algebraic data types as a starting
! point, if you find that helpful.
! 
! For the purpose of this task, it would be best to verify the integrity
! of the red-black tree after every insert and after every delete.
