! An audio frequency generator produces a continual audible monotone at a
! set frequency and level of volume. There are controls to adjust the
! frequency and the volume up and down as desired. Some also have a
! selector to switch the waveform type between sine wave, square wave and
! triangular sawtooth.
! 
! The task is to emulate an audio frequency generator. It is permissible
! to use an inbuilt computer speaker if the system does not have the
! facility to utilize dedicated sound hardware.
! 
! The solution should include:
! 
! -   A demonstration of how to check for availability of sound hardware
!     on the system (on systems where this is possible)
! -   A demonstration of how to produce a continual audible monotone (on
!     sound hardware this would typically be a sine wave)
! -   A method of adjusting the frequency and volume of the monotone. (one
!     way would be to use left and right arrow keys to increase or
!     decrease frequency, and up and down keys to increase or decrease the
!     volume)
! -   A method to silence or reset the sound hardware on exit.
! 
! Optionally the solution can also include:
! 
! -   A demonstration of how to fall back to internal speaker, if sound
!     hardware is not available
! -   A facility to switch between sine wave, square wave and triangular
!     sawtooth
! 
! Languages that provide no facilities for utilizing sound hardware of any
! kind should be omitted.
