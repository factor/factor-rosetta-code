! Magic numbers are polydivisible numbers in base 10. A polydivisible
! number is an m digit number where the first n digits are evenly
! divisible by n for all n from 1 to m.
! 
! E.G. The number 1868587 is a magic number (is polydivisible in base 10.)
! 
!           1 ÷ 1 = 1
!          18 ÷ 2 = 9
!         186 ÷ 3 = 62
!        1868 ÷ 4 = 467
!       18685 ÷ 5 = 3737
!      186858 ÷ 6 = 31143
!     1868587 ÷ 7 = 266941
! 
! There is a finite number of magic numbers.

! Task
! 
! -   Write a routine (subroutine, function, procedure, generator,

! -   Use that routine to find and display how many magic numbers exist.
! -   Use that routine to find and display the largest possible magic
!     number.
! -   Count and display how many magic numbers have 1 digit, 2 digits, 3
!     digits, ... for all magic numbers.
! -   Find and display all of the magic numbers that are minimally
!     pandigital in 1 through 9. (Contains each digit but only once.)
! -   Find and display all of the magic numbers that are minimally
!     pandigital in 0 through 9.
