! Implement Martin Gardner’s game Hexapawn so that one can play against
! the computer. Hexapawn is played on a 3 x 3 square board. The near rank
! contains your three pawns, and the far rank contains those of the
! computer.
! 
! It should “memorize” good moves and discard bad ones, after enough
! rounds, it will have learned from its mistakes and will become
! unbeatable.
! 
! Description.
! 
! Extras:
! 
! -   Make the board size variable. The player should decide it
! -   It would be cool to have a trainer, so you don’t need to keep
!     playing until the computer learns it
