! Sometimes it is useful to run code with inputs from untrusted users,
! untrusted code, etc. Explain and demonstrate the features your language
! uses for dealing with untrusted input and untrusted code. Explain
! possible compromises, weaknesses and exploits that may be available
! through the language (for example forcing execution of something outside
! of the application) as a result of using untrusted data sources.
! 
! The intention is that the definition is to be interpreted broadly;
! different languages will solve this task in very different ways and with
! (generally) incomparable results.
