! One of the foundational mathematical constructs behind computer science
! is the universal machine, as a machine that can emulate the behaviour of
! any other machine, given a description of it. Alan Turing introduced the
! idea of a universal Turing machine in 1936â€“1937.
! 
! The lambda calculus is an even older, and in many ways simpler, model of
! computation. That simplicity is reflected in the Binary Lambda Calculus
! (BLC for short), which describes lambda terms with binary tokens 00 for
! lambda, 01 for application, and 1^n0 for variable n (which binds to the
! n'th enclosing lambda).
! 
! BLC also specifies a way to represent bits and lists as lambda terms,
! which provides the following I/O convention:
! 
! The lambda universal machine parses the binary encoding of a lambda term
! from the start of its input, applies that term to the remainder of
! input, and outputs the result interpreted as a list of bits or bytes.
! 
! BLC as a programming language has its own entry on Rosetta Code at
! https://rosettacode.org/wiki/Category:Binary_Lambda_Calculus which links
! to more detailed descriptions of the language.
! 
! Task:
! 
! Simulate the universal lambda machine Or in other words, write a BLC
! interpreter. Support either bit-mode or byte-mode, or preferably both
! (with byte-mode as the default, and a -b command line flag for bit
! mode).
! 
! To test your universal lambda machine, you should execute the following
! BLC programs.
! 
! For bit-mode, one should reproduce the BLC Rosetta Code solutions of

! 
! producing as much output as possible before running out of stack/heap
! space).
