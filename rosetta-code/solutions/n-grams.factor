! An N-gram is a sequence of N contiguous elements of a given text.
! Although N-grams refer sometimes to words or syllables, in this task we
! will consider only sequences of characters. The task consists in, given
! a text and an integer size of the desired N-grams, find all the
! different contiguous sequences of N characters, together with the number
! of times they appear in the text. For example, the 2-grams of the text
! "Live and let live" are:
! 
!  "LI" - 2
!  "IV" - 2
!  "VE" - 2
!  " L" - 2
!  "E " - 1
!  " A" - 1
!  "AN" - 1
!  "ND" - 1
!  "D " - 1
!  "LE" - 1
!  "ET" - 1
!  "T " - 1
! 
! Note that space and other non-alphanumeric characters are taken into
! account.
