! Implement a self-hosting compiler for your language, i.e.: create a
! compiler that is implemented in the language it's supposed to compile.
! 
! Extra credit for any solution that can compile in an online compiler
! such as Ideone.
! 
! If this isn't feasible due to language complexity, link to external
! projects that achieve this task.
