! Definition
! 
! Let p(1), p(2), p(3), ... , p(n) be consecutive prime numbers. If the
! sum of any consecutive sub-sequence of these numbers is a prime number,
! then the numbers in such a sub-sequence are called CalmoSoft primes.
! 
! Task
! 
! Find and show here the longest sequence of CalmoSoft primes for p(n) <
! 100.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! Show a shortened version (first and last 6 primes) of the same for p(n)
! < fifty million.
! 
! Tip: if it takes longer than twenty seconds, you're doing it wrong.
