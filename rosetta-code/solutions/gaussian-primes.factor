! A Gaussian Integer is a complex number such that its real and imaginary
! parts are both integers.
! 
!    a + bi where a and b are integers and i is √-1.
! 
! The norm of a Gaussian integer is its product with its conjugate.
! 
!    N(a + bi) = (a + bi)(a − bi) = a² + b²
! 
! A Gaussian integer is a Gaussian prime if and only if either: both a and
! b are non-zero and its norm is a prime number, or, one of a or b is zero
! and it is the product of a unit (±1, ±i) and a prime integer of the form
! 4n + 3.
! 
! Prime integers that are not of the form 4n + 3 can be factored into a
! Gaussian integer and its complex conjugate so are not a Gaussian prime.
! 
!    E.G. 5 = (2 + i)(2 − i) So 5 is not a Gaussian prime
! 
! Gaussian primes are octogonally symmetrical on a real / imaginary
! Cartesian field. If a particular complex norm a² + b² is prime, since
! addition is commutative, b² + a² is also prime, as are the complex
! conjugates and negated instances of both.
! 
! Task
! 
! Find and show, here on this page, the Gaussian primes with a norm of
! less than 100, (within a radius of 10 from the origin 0 + 0i on a
! complex plane.)
! 
! Plot the points corresponding to the Gaussian primes on a Cartesian real
! / imaginary plane at least up to a radius of 50.
