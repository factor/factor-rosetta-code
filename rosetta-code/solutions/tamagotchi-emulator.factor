! If you don't know what Tamagotchi is, take a look at the Wikipedia page
! about it.
! 
! This task is about creating a Tamagotchi emulator, a virtual pet that
! you must take care of.
! 
! Your virtual pet must, like real pets, at least: get hungry, get bored,
! age and poop!
! Against hunger, you must create a way to feed it. Against boredom, you
! must play with or pet it. The poop must be cleaned, otherwise the pet
! might get sick and if it is not cured, it might die from its disease.
! Finally, the pet should grow older and eventually die.
! 
! On screen, your program must display the virtual pet status data - age,
! hunger and happiness levels, when the pet poops, its poop must also be
! displayed. Ah, well, an avatar of the pet must be there too, but I guess
! that's obvious!
! 
! What else? Well, use your creativity…
! Every pet needs a name. What kind of games, or ‘mini games’ one can play
! with his pet? And so on!
! 
! But, above of all, have fun!
