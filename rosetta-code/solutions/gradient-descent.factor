! Gradient descent (also known as steepest descent) is a first-order
! iterative optimization algorithm for finding the minimum of a function
! which is described in this Wikipedia article.
! 
! Task
! 
! Use this algorithm to search for minimum values of the bi-variate
! function:
! 
!   f(x, y) = (x - 1)(x - 1)e^(-y^2) + y(y+2)e^(-2x^2)
! 
! around x = 0.1 and y = -1.
! 
! This book excerpt shows sample C# code for solving this task.
