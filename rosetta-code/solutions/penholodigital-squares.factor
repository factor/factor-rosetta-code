! Penholodigital squares are perfect square numbers that contain all of
! the digits from the base in which the number is represented, except for
! zero, exactly once.
! 
! From the Latin prefix pene- (before, or next to, nearly)
! 
! and holo- (whole, or all)
! 
! penholodigital: Nearly-all-digits.
! 
! So, in a particular base, a penholodigital square number will contain
! all of the digits used in that base (except zero) once, and only once.
! Base eight penholodigitals contain the digits 1 through 7, base 10, 1
! through 9, etc.
! 
! For example
! 
! In base 10, 139854276 is a penholodigital square. It is the square of
! the integer 11826, and contains every digit from 1 through 9 exactly
! once.
! 
! Penholodigital squares can occur in many, though not every, base. They
! tend to be pretty rare in lower bases.
! 
!     There is a total of 1 penholodigital squares in base 2:
!     1² = 1
! 
!     There is a total of 0 penholodigital squares in base 3:
! 
!     There is a total of 0 penholodigital squares in base 4:
! 
!     There is a total of 0 penholodigital squares in base 5:
! 
!     There is a total of 2 penholodigital squares in base 6:
!     122² = 15324, 221² = 53241
! 
!     There is a total of 1 penholodigital squares in base 7:
!     645² = 623514
! 
!     There is a total of 1 penholodigital squares in base 8:
!     2453² = 6532471
! 
! Task
! 
! Find and display the total count, and the penholodigital squares and the
! integers that are squared to produce them, represented in the base in
! which they are calculated, for bases 9, 10, 11 and 12.
! 
! Stretch
! 
! Find and display the total count, and the first and last penholodigital
! squares and the integers that are squared to produce them, represented
! in the base in which they are calculated, for bases 13, 14, 15, ... ?
