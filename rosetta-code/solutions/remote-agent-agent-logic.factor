! In Remote agent, a game is described where an agent interacts with a
! simple world of walls, balls and squares, and a component is described
! that marshals commands between the simulation environment and the logic
! code behind the agent.
! 
! The goal conditions for the game are to get all balls in squares of
! matching colors, in as few turns as possible.
! 
! Using an interface for your language write a program that attempts to
! reach these goals. The exact agent behavior within the simulated
! environment is unspecified.
