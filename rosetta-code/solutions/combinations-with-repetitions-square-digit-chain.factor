! Iterated digits squaring introduces RC the Project Euler Task #92.
! Combinations with repetitions introduce RC to the concept of generating
! all the combinations with repetitions of n types of things taken k at a
! time.
! 
! The purpose of this task is to combine these tasks as follows:
! 
!     The collections of k items will be taken from
!     [0,1,4,9,16,25,36,49,64,81] and must be obtained using code from
!     Combinations with repetitions. The collection of k zeroes is
!     excluded.
!     For each collection of k items determine if it translates to 1 using
!     the rules from Iterated digits squaring
!     For each collection which translates to 1 determine the number of
!     different ways, c say, in which the k items can be uniquely ordered.
!     Keep a running total of all the values of c obtained
!     Answer the Project Euler Task #92 question (k=7).
!     Answer the equivalent question for k=8,11,14.
!     Optionally answer the question for k=17. These numbers will be
!     larger than the basic integer type for many languages, if it is not
!     easy to use larger numbers it is not necessary for this task.
