! A readline interface is a line editing facility that provides auto
! completion facilities and the ability to recall previously typed lines.
! Build a simple application that accepts at least two commands and uses a
! readline style interface.
! 
! The interface should provide
! 
! -   the ability to recall previously typed commands
! -   commandline editing
! -   application specific commands
! 
! The application could be based on Simple database or something else.
! 
! If the language already provides a readline interface, then it should be
! demonstrated how build an application specific readline interface (one
! that only understands the applications commands) and also show how to
! customize the builtin readline to provide the above features and
! especially add application specific commands.
