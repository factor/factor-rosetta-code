! Let say you have some coins in your wallet and you want to have a given
! sum.
! 
! You can use each coin zero or one time.
! 
! How many ways can you do it ?
! 
! The result should be a number.
! 
! For instance the answer is 10 when coins = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and sum = 6.
! ;Task Show the result for the following examples:
! 
! -   coins = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and sum = 6
! 
! -   coins = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3, 4, 5] and sum = 6
! 
! -   coins = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5, 5, 5, 15, 15, 10, 10, 10, 10, 25, 100]
!     and sum = 40
! 
! Extra
! 
! -   Show the result of the same examples when the order you take the
!     coins doesn't matter. For instance the answer is 3 when coins = [1,
!     2, 3, 4, 5] and sum = 6.
! 
! -   Show an example of coins you used to reach the given sum and their
!     indices. See Raku for this case.
