! This is a method of randomly sampling n items from a set of M items,
! with equal probability; where M >= n and M, the number of items is
! unknown until the end. This means that the equal probability sampling
! should be maintained for all successive items > n as they become
! available (although the content of successive samples can change).
! 
! The algorithm:
! 
! -   -   Select the first n items as the sample as they become available;
!     -   For the i-th item where i > n, have a random chance of n/i of
!         keeping it. If failing this chance, the sample remains the same.
!         If not, have it randomly (1/n) replace one of the previously
!         selected n items of the sample.
!     -   Repeat 2^(nd) step for any subsequent items.
! 
! The Task:
! 
! -   -   Create a function s_of_n_creator that given n the maximum sample
!         size, returns a function s_of_n that takes one parameter, item.
!     -   Function s_of_n when called with successive items returns an
!         equi-weighted random sample of up to n of its items so far, each
!         time it is called, calculated using Knuths Algorithm S.
!     -   Test your functions by printing and showing the frequency of
!         occurrences of the selected digits from 100,000 repetitions of:
! 
! :::# Use the s_of_n_creator with n == 3 to generate an s_of_n.
! 
! :::# call s_of_n with each of the digits 0 to 9 in order, keeping the
! returned three digits of its random sampling from its last call with
! argument item=9.
! 
! Note: A class taking n and generating a callable instance/function might
! also be used.
