! Definition
! 
! In object-oriented programming, a sealed or final class is one which
! cannot be inherited from.
! 
! Classes are sometimes made non-subclassable in this way if the author
! feels that it would not be useful or even undesirable for subclasses to
! be created from them. Moreover, in a compiled language, knowing that a
! class cannot be subclassed, may enable optimizations to be made.
! 
! Rather than sealing the entire class, it may be possible to just seal
! certain methods for the same reasons and with the same potential
! benefits.
! 
! Task
! 
! If your language supports the object oriented paradigm, explain what
! support it has for sealed classes and/or methods and, if there is no
! support, what if anything can be done to simulate them. If possible
! illustrate your answer with an example.
! 
! If your language does not support the object oriented paradigm (or its
! inheritance aspect), you may either simply say so, omit the task
! altogether or describe any equivalent structure(s) and restrictions on
! use which the language does have.
