! Analyse a given section of monophonic audio waveform, for average pitch
! and output one of the sol-fa trigraphs (like these, except each has
! three letters) corresponding to average pitch level: Doh, Ray, Mee, Fah,
! Soh, Lah, Tee, doh.
! 
! Optionally, follow the trigraph with a plus or minus symbol, to indicate
! whether the note falls above or below the solfa. Extend the scale to
! cover 21 notes: DOH, RAY, MEE, FAH, SOH, LAH, TEE, Doh, Ray, Mee, Fah,
! Soh, Lah, Tee, doh, ray, mee, fah, soh, lah, tee.
! 
! A calibration parameter can be provided to suit different voices. This
! can be provided as a variable defined within the code.
