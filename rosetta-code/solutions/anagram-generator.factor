! There are already other tasks relating to finding existing anagrams.
! This one is about creating them.
! 
! Write a (set of) routine(s) that, when given a word list to work from,
! and word or phrase as a seed, generates anagrams of that word or phrase.
! Feel free to ignore letter case, white-space, punctuation and symbols.
! Probably best to avoid numerics too, but feel free to include them if
! that floats your boat.
! 
! It is not necessary to (only) generate anagrams that make sense. That is
! a hard problem, much more difficult than can realistically be done in a
! small program; though again, if you feel the need, you are invited to
! amaze your peers.
! 
! In general, try to form phrases made up of longer words. Feel free to
! manually reorder output words or add punctuation and/or case changes to
! get a better meaning.
! 
! Task
! 
! Write an anagram generator program.
! 
! Use a publicly and freely available word file as its word list.
! 
!     unixdict.txt from http://wiki.puzzlers.org is a popular, though
!     somewhat limited choice.
!     A much larger word list: words_alpha.txt file from
!     https://github.com/dwyl/english-words. May be better as far as
!     coverage but may return unreasonably large results.
! 
! Use your program to generate anagrams of some words / phrases / names of
! your choice. No need to show all the output. It is likely to be very
! large. Just pick out one or two of the best results and show the seed
! word/phrase and anagram.
! 
! For example, show the seed and one or two of the best anagrams:
! 
!     Purefox -> Fur expo
!     Petelomax -> Metal expo
! 
! .oO(hmmm. Seem to be detecting something of a trend here...)
