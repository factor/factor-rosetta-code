! In the early times, chess used to be the prime example of artificial
! intelligence. Nowadays, some chess programs can beat a human master, and
! simple implementations can be written in a few pages of code.
! 
! Write a program which plays chess against a human player.
! 
! No need for graphics -- a textual user interface is sufficient.
! 
! Rather than implementing a complete monolithic program, you may wish to
! tackle one of the simpler sub-tasks:
! 
! 1.  Chess player/Move generation
! 2.  Chess player/Search and evaluation
! 3.  Chess player/Program options and user interface
! 
! or use those components as part of a complete program, demonstrating
! your language's support for modularity.
