! Task:
! 
! Generate and show a maze, using the simple Depth-first search algorithm.
! 
! 1.  Start at a random cell.
! 2.  Mark the current cell as visited, and get a list of its neighbors.
!     For each neighbor, starting with a randomly selected neighbor:
! 
!         If that neighbor hasn't been visited, remove the wall between
!         this cell and that neighbor, and then recurse with that neighbor
!         as the current cell.
