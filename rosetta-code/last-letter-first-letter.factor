! A certain children's game involves starting with a word in a particular
! category. Each participant in turn says a word, but that word must begin
! with the final letter of the previous word. Once a word has been given,
! it cannot be repeated. If an opponent cannot give a word in the
! category, they fall out of the game.
! 
! For example, with "animals" as the category,
! 
!     Child 1: dog 
!     Child 2: goldfish
!     Child 1: hippopotamus
!     Child 2: snake
!     ...
! 
! Task:
! 
! Take the following selection of 70 English Pokemon names (extracted from
! Wikipedia's list of Pokemon) and generate the/a sequence with the
! highest possible number of Pokemon names where the subsequent name
! starts with the final letter of the preceding name.
! 
! No Pokemon name is to be repeated.
