! Task:
! 
! Sort an array (or list) of elements using the Selection sort algorithm.
! 
! It works as follows:
! 
! First find the smallest element in the array and exchange it with the
! element in the first position, then find the second smallest element and
! exchange it with the element in the second position, and continue in
! this way until the entire array is sorted.
! 
! Its asymptotic complexity is O(nÂ²) making it inefficient on large
! arrays.
! 
! Its primary purpose is for when writing data is very expensive (slow)
! when compared to reading, eg. writing to flash memory or EEPROM.
! 
! No other sorting algorithm has less data movement.
