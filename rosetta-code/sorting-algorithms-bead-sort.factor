! Task:
! 
! Sort an array of positive integers using the Bead Sort Algorithm.
! 
! A bead sort is also known as a gravity sort.
! 
! Algorithm has O(S), where S is the sum of the integers in the input set:
! Each bead is moved individually.
! 
! This is the case when bead sort is implemented without a mechanism to
! assist in finding empty spaces below the beads, such as in software
! implementations.

( scratchpad ) { 5 2 4 1 3 3 9 } beadsort .
{ 9 5 4 3 3 2 1 }
