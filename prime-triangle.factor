! You will require a function f which when given an integer S will return
! a list of the arrangements of the integers 1 to S such that g₁=1 g_(S)=S
! and generally for n=1 to n=S-1 g_(n)+g_(n+1) is prime. S=1 is undefined.
! For S=2 to S=20 print f(S) to form a triangle. Then again for S=2 to
! S=20 print the number of possible arrangements of 1 to S meeting these
! requirements.
