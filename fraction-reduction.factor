! There is a fine line between numerator and denominator. â”€â”€â”€ anonymous
! 
! A method to "reduce" some reducible fractions is to cross out a digit
! from the numerator and the denominator. An example is:
! 
! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 16Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1~~6~~
! Â Â Â Â Â Â â”€â”€â”€â”€Â Â Â Â Â andÂ thenÂ (simply)Â crossâ”€outÂ theÂ sixes:Â Â Â Â Â Â â”€â”€â”€â”€
! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 64Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â ~~6~~4
! 
! resulting in:
! 
! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 1
! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â â”€â”€â”€Â Â Â Â 
! Â Â Â Â Â Â Â Â 4
! 
! Naturally, this "method" of reduction must reduce to the proper value
! (shown as a fraction).
! 
! This "method" is also known as anomalous cancellation and also
! accidental cancellation.
! 
! (Of course, this "method" shouldn't be taught to impressionable or
! gullible minds.) ðŸ˜‡
! 
! Task:
! 
! Find and show some fractions that can be reduced by the above "method".
! 
! -   -   show 2-digit fractions found (like the example shown above)
!     -   show 3-digit fractions
!     -   show 4-digit fractions
!     -   show 5-digit fractions (and higher) (optional)
!     -   show each (above) n-digit fractions separately from other
!         different n-sized fractions, don't mix different "sizes"
!         together
!     -   for each "size" fraction, only show a dozen examples (the 1^(st)
!         twelve found)
!     -   (it's recognized that not every programming solution will have
!         the same generation algorithm)
!     -   for each "size" fraction:
!         -   -   show a count of how many reducible fractions were found.
!                 The example (above) is size 2
!             -   show a count of which digits were crossed out (one line
!                 for each different digit)
!     -   for each "size" fraction, show a count of how many were found.
!         The example (above) is size 2
!     -   show each n-digit example (to be shown on one line):
!         -   -   show each n-digit fraction
!             -   show each reduced n-digit fraction
!             -   show what digit was crossed out for the numerator and
!                 the denominator
! 
! Task requirements/restrictions:
! 
! -   -   only proper fractions and their reductions (the result) are to
!         be used (no vulgar fractions)
!     -   only positive fractions are to be used (no negative signs
!         anywhere)
!     -   only base ten integers are to be used for the numerator and
!         denominator
!     -   no zeros (decimal digit) can be used within the numerator or the
!         denominator
!     -   the numerator and denominator should be composed of the same
!         number of digits
!     -   no digit can be repeated in the numerator
!     -   no digit can be repeated in the denominator
!     -   (naturally) there should be a shared decimal digit in the
!         numerator and the denominator
!     -   fractions can be shown as 16/64 (for example)
